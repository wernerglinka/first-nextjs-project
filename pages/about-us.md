                    Geologically, the region is defined by coal-bearing layers from the upper Carboniferous period. The coal seams reach the surface in a strip along the river Ruhr and dip downward from the river to the north. Beneath the Lippe, the coal seams lie at a depth of 2,000 to 2,600 ft.

                    Once known for its belching steelworks and filthy coal mines, the Ruhrgebiet – a sprawling post-industrial region of 53 cities  – is considered part of the larger Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, which is among the largest in Europe, behind only London and Paris.

                    The Ruhrpott is a former industrial area centrally located in North Rhine Westphalia. The region takes its name partly from the river Ruhr and the word “Pott” which comes from “Kohlenpott” (meaning “coal pot”) alluding to the area’s coal-mining past.
